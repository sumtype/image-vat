# Image Vat

An image gallery built with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Masonry](https://github.com/desandro/masonry), and [Lightbox2](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2) in [client](https://github.com/JHM90/image-vat/tree/master/client) and [server](https://github.com/JHM90/image-vat/tree/master/server) components.  The client provides an image gallery where users can add images to a database (and thereby the gallery) by submitting a URL (required) and a description (optional).  The server provides a one resource REST API for the client to query with GET and POST requests to view images in and add images to a connected database.
